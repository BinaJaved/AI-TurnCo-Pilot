# 🚗 AI Turn Co-Pilot — Project Plan

# Demo
./demo.gif

### 🎯 **Objective**

To build a **Generative AI-powered driving co-pilot** that delivers **adaptive, human-like alerts** before turns — helping drivers stay alert, especially when distracted, drowsy, or misjudging turns.
Unlike traditional systems (like Tesla’s fixed alerts), this solution **learns from driver behavior** and dynamically **personalizes** tone, urgency, and phrasing to prevent alert fatigue.

---

## 🧩 **MVP Scope**

The MVP will:

* Simulate driving scenarios (no sensors yet).
* Generate **natural, varied alerts** for different turn situations.
* Adapt to the driver’s behavior using lightweight in-memory personalization.
* Include a simple UI with scenario buttons for testing.

---

## 🖥️ **Core Features**

### 1. **Scenario Simulation UI**

* Buttons for test cases:

  * 🚗 Left Turn
  * 🚦 Distracted Driver
  * 🌧️ Rainy Weather
  * 🚶 Pedestrian Crossing
  * 😴 Drowsy Driver
* Each button sends contextual data to the AI model.

### 2. **Generative Alert Engine**

* Uses OpenAI GPT to create **context-aware voice alerts**.
* Alerts vary in tone, word choice, and intensity.
* Repeated scenarios trigger adaptive changes in style and urgency.

### 3. **Behavioral Adaptation**

* Stores the last 5 driver scenarios and responses in memory.
* Adjusts the next alert based on recurring behavior:

  * Frequent distraction → firmer tone.
  * Drowsiness → empathetic but urgent tone.
* Avoids identical responses to maintain driver attention.

### 4. **Voice Playback**

* Uses `pyttsx3` or `gTTS` for text-to-speech playback.
* Adds realism for testing how alerts might sound in real vehicles.

### 5. **Scenario Log**

* Displays the last few simulated alerts with timestamps.
* Useful for debugging and observing adaptive learning.

## 🧠 **How It Learns**

* Every scenario click updates a mini “driver profile.”
* Profile tracks recurring conditions like **distraction** or **drowsiness**.
* Future alerts are personalized:

  * If “Distracted” appears often → tone becomes more direct.
  * If “Drowsy” repeats → alerts use supportive language and stronger emphasis.
* AI model prompt dynamically includes past patterns for contextual response.

---

## 🧪 **Testing Plan**

### 🧍 Local Testing

1. Run app on Replit.
2. Click scenario buttons to simulate driving conditions.
3. Observe alert text and tone changes over multiple runs.
4. Enable “Personalization Mode” to test adaptive variation.

### 🧩 Expected Behavior

* Repeated scenarios → non-identical responses.
* Alerts escalate naturally in tone (without sounding robotic).
* Scenario log shows pattern-based adaptation.

## 📊 **Impact Justification**

According to the **U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)**:

* Over **22% of road accidents** involve **misjudged or improper turns**.
* **41%** of these occur under **distracted or drowsy conditions**.

If adaptive AI alerts can reduce even **10%** of these incidents, that equates to **thousands of lives saved annually** and a major leap toward safer, smarter driving.
