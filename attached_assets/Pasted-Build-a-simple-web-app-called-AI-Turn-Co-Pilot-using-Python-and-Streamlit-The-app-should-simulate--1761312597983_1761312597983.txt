Build a simple web app called AI Turn Co-Pilot using Python and Streamlit.

The app should simulate real driving scenarios to test adaptive, generative AI alerts for preventing car accidents — especially misjudged turns.

✅ App Requirements

The UI should have buttons for testing driving situations, such as:

🚗 Left Turn

🚦 Distracted Driver

🌧️ Rainy Weather

🚶 Pedestrian Crossing

😴 Drowsy Driver

When a user clicks a scenario button, the app should:

Send a descriptive prompt to an OpenAI model (GPT) that generates a context-specific driving alert.

The alert should adapt based on previous user behavior — e.g., if the user triggered “drowsy driver” twice, make the next alert firmer or more personalized.

Use varied tone and phrasing to avoid repetition (humans tune out identical alerts).

Display the generated AI Alert text on the screen.

Add a “Replay Alert” button that reads the AI’s response out loud using pyttsx3 or gTTS.

Maintain a Scenario Log showing the last 5 alerts (so the app can adapt its responses based on history).

Make the app lightweight and fast, with a simple, clean UI.

⚙️ Behavior Adaptation Rules

Track which scenarios were clicked most often (e.g., “drowsy driver” or “distracted driver”).

If the same scenario repeats, slightly change the tone of future alerts — for example:

1st time: “Heads up — you seem distracted. Let’s refocus.”

2nd time: “You’ve been distracted again — please keep both eyes on the road.”

3rd time: “Critical alert — distraction detected multiple times. Take a short break.”

The app should store this minimal “memory” locally (e.g., in a Python dictionary or JSON file).

🧠 AI Prompt Example
Scenario: Drowsy Driver  
Past Alerts: ["You seem distracted. Refocus on the road."]  
Generate a calm, human-like voice alert that feels natural and non-repetitive.  
Include slight tone variation to keep the driver attentive.

🎯 Goal

The goal is to demonstrate how adaptive, generative AI can simulate a personalized driving co-pilot that learns from user behavior and keeps the driver alert — unlike traditional, repetitive alerts in cars today.
